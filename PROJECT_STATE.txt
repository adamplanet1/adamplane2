CURRENT STATE:
- Project structure is correct (index/product/category + assets folders)
- UI style is dark/glass and responsive

MAIN ISSUE FIXED BY THIS VERSION:
- Images were not showing due to mismatch between real filenames (-600 / -1200) and referenced paths
- This version uses imageBase and auto-resolves the proper file at runtime

NEXT:
- Verify each image exists:
  assets/images/products/<cat>/<name>-1200.webp or -600.webp
- If any image missing, either upload it or rely on fallback to the existing size
- After deploy, test:
  - Home categories images
  - Featured products images
  - Product page large image
  - Related products images
  - Language switch AR/DE
  - Menu open/close
