PROJECT: DekoKraft (Static site on GitHub Pages)
STACK: HTML + CSS + Vanilla JavaScript + JSON only

FILES:
- index.html: Home (Hero + Category cards + Featured products + Kontakt)
- category.html: Category page (Grid of products of a selected category + Kontakt)
- product.html: Product page (Large image + title + description + related products + Kontakt)
- assets/css/main.css: One stylesheet for all pages
- assets/js/main.js: Menu, language toggle, JSON loading, rendering, image resolving
- assets/data/products.json: Database of products

LANGUAGES:
- AR and DE.
- AR => dir=rtl, DE => dir=ltr.
- Use localStorage "lang" to remember.

CRITICAL IMAGE RULE:
- Product images are NOT stored as gift-001.webp
- They are stored as: gift-001-600.webp / gift-001-1200.webp etc.
- products.json must store imageBase only, e.g.:
  "imageBase": "assets/images/products/gifts/gift-001"
- main.js must auto-resolve:
  prefer "-1200.webp" then "-600.webp", else fallback placeholder.

RENDERING RULES:
- Category cards on home show an image and a button "عرض القسم / Bereich ansehen".
- Featured products show same card style but without button; clicking card opens product.html?id=...
- Product page has NO big category title; only product info + similar products + Kontakt.
- Kontakt section is identical on all pages.

WORKFLOW:
- When modifying files, output full file content.
